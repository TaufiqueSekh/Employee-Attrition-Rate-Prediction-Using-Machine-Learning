# Employee-Attrition-Rate-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

Nowadays, firms are expanding at a tremendous rate, and with this mass expansion, experienced professionals are in high demand by the companies. An experienced employee is like an asset to the company; upon losing, companies either try to retain the employee with a revised compensation, or they can always hire a new employee. However, predicting this can save a lot of money and time. Additionally, it will allow the company's management to control a project pipeline efficiently, enabling them to manage the hiring and existing workforce flexibly. But let's first understand,

## What is Attrition?

When an employee moves out of the company either voluntarily or involuntarily, it is known as attrition. The attrition rate is calculated as the percent of employees who have left the organization by the average number of employees.

Ideally, the average attrition rate should be less than 10%, and an attrition rate greater than 20% is alarming for any company. Following are some reasons for high attrition rates:

Poor management
Lack of recognition
Toxic work environment 
Lack of career growth
The above list is quite intuitive, and as we start exploring the data, we will find more reasons for attrition. This blog will develop an attrition prediction model, which will help us predict the employees likely to leave the organization in the coming time. Let's start with the data analysis:

Attrition Data Analysis

We are interested in exploring the exciting patterns that lead to employee attrition. At the end of the analysis, we will try to model employee attrition by predicting the possible attritions using specific machine learning models. We will be using Kaggle's IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset for this analysis, and it has 35 features with 1470 rows of employee data. Further, there are no missing values in this dataset. Let's take a look at the code.
